# Star Shooter Similator

This project mainly demonstrates my newly learned P5js knowledge about "map" meanwhile revisiting the knowlege I learned in previous classes.

## Summary

People can interact with this project by clicking the right and left arrow to control the shooter while using mouse to control the color of the background. In addition, a simple "pop" sound will be played after one loop is completeted. 

## Component Parts

1. the stars in the background that are deviating from the circle center;
2. the pop sound;
3. the shooter that is responsive to user's action.
4. the bullet.

## When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 1: Write Proposal, flush out initial code for your idea
- Week 2: Gathering resources, learning 'map' founction and review array function
- Week 3: Creating the actual code.
- Week 4: Present!
 
## Challenges

The main challenge of this project is that I wanted to add a lot of things that I did not learn from the course and I have a lot of thought about it. Hence I spent a lot of time checking out other people's project and tutorial and eventually the amount of time I spend on my project is far less comparing to the actual time I spendt on coding my project.
